## Available for a wide range of browsers
The extension has been developed to work with as many browsers as possible. It will work with applications such as [Mozilla Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/pl/firefox/addon/better-kbin/), [Google Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/better-kbin/lhjckkbpebkjgjmlcladdmcabkgkffkp) or [Microsoft Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/better-kbin/ackoiabiafbmmeknggaoaicibeejbkfl).

## FAQ

### Is Better /kbin compatible with other websites?
Better /kbin should work correctly on all instances using the original /kbin source code.

### Is support for Safari planned?
No. It's technically possible to create a version for Safari browsers, but publishing to the App Store requires a developer account fee, which I don't have the funds for, and since the extension is free, there's no way to cover the cost of a developer account.

If you want, you can create a Safari version of this extension yourself, while be sure to stick to the [licence](https://github.com/MStankiewiczOfficial/BetterKbin/blob/main/LICENSE).

### Will Better /kbin be developed?
Hard to say. Unfortunately, it looks like the /kbin project itself is not being developed, so it is likely that if this state persists, this repository will be archived, which will mean the end of development for Better /kbin.
